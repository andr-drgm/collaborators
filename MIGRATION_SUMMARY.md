# Dashboard Migration Summary

## Overview

Successfully migrated the main dashboard from the original contribution tracking system to focus on the bounty marketplace system for the hackathon MVP.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dashboard Page (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)

- **Before**: Displayed project contributions, commit stats, token claiming, and project management
- **After**: Now displays the bounty marketplace with four main tabs:
  - **Search Issues**: Search GitHub issues and add bounties
  - **My Issues**: View your GitHub issues
  - **Active Bounties**: Browse all active bounties
  - **My Bounties**: Manage bounties you've created
- **Kept**: ProfileCard component with user profile image

### 2. Archived Components

All old dashboard components have been moved to archive directories for future use:

#### Dashboard Components (`src/components/dashboard/archive/`)

- `OnboardingBanner.tsx` - Onboarding banner
- `StatsCards.tsx` - Stats cards (commits, tokens held, tokens claimed)
- `ContributionChart.tsx` - Contribution chart
- `ProjectSelector.tsx` - Project selector
- `HelpModal.tsx` - Help modal
- `NoProjectsMessage.tsx` - No projects message
- `LoadingOverlay.tsx` - Loading overlay
- `TweetApprovalInfo.tsx` - Tweet approval info
- `TokenClaimButton.tsx` - Token claim button
- `ProjectModal.tsx` - Project management modal

#### Hooks (`src/hooks/archive/`)

- `useDashboard.ts` - Original dashboard hook

#### Utils (`src/utils/archive/`)

- `dashboardUtils.ts` - Dashboard utility functions

### 3. Removed Pages

- `src/app/bounties/page.tsx` - Deleted (functionality moved to dashboard)

### 4. Components Still in Use

- `ProfileCard.tsx` - User profile with image display
- `WalletConnect.tsx` - Wallet connection component
- `BotInstallationStatus.tsx` - Bot installation status

## User Profile Implementation

The dashboard now displays user profile information using Privy's linked accounts:

- **User Name**: GitHub username, or email prefix, or "User"
- **Profile Image**: GitHub profile picture if available
- **Member Since**: Account creation date

## Key Features

1. **Bounty Creation**: Users can search issues and create bounties
2. **Bounty Management**: Users can view, edit, and delete their bounties
3. **Solution Submission**: Developers can submit solutions via PR
4. **Bot Installation**: Shows bot installation status for repositories

## Archive Documentation

Each archive directory contains a README.md explaining what was archived and why.

## Build Status

âœ… Build successful - All TypeScript errors resolved

## Future Considerations

The archived components can be easily restored when returning to the original dashboard functionality. The archive includes:

- Project contribution tracking
- Commit statistics
- Token claiming system
- Tweet approval workflow
