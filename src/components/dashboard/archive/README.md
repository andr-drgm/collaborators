# Archived Dashboard Components

This directory contains dashboard components that were archived during the shift to focusing on the bounty system MVP.

## Archived Components

These components were part of the original dashboard functionality that tracked:

- Project contributions
- Commit statistics
- Token claiming functionality

### Components:

1. **OnboardingBanner.tsx** - Onboarding banner for new users
2. **StatsCards.tsx** - Stats cards showing commits, tokens held, and tokens claimed
3. **ContributionChart.tsx** - Chart showing contribution history
4. **ProjectSelector.tsx** - Component for selecting projects
5. **HelpModal.tsx** - Help modal for explaining features
6. **NoProjectsMessage.tsx** - Message shown when user has no projects
7. **LoadingOverlay.tsx** - Loading overlay component
8. **TweetApprovalInfo.tsx** - Info about tweet approval functionality
9. **TokenClaimButton.tsx** - Button for claiming tokens
10. **ProjectModal.tsx** - Modal for managing projects

## Components Kept

These components are still in use for the new bounty-focused dashboard:

- **ProfileCard.tsx** - User profile card with image
- **WalletConnect.tsx** - Wallet connection component

## Reason for Archive

The hackathon requires an MVP focused on the bounty system. The original dashboard tracked contributions and token claiming, but we're now prioritizing the bounty marketplace functionality. These components are archived for future use when we return to the original dashboard features.
